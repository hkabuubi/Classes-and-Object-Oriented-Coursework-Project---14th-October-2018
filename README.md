# Classes-and-Object-Oriented-Coursework-Project---14th-October-2018
The coursework revolves around the implementation of a stock control system for a small shop. This
system will have a list of stock items, their quantity in stock and methods for adding new stock,
checking stock levels and selling stock. A half-finished version is provided, in StockControl.py. The
aim of the coursework is to implement the unfinished methods, add new methods and extend the class
to cater for perishable stock items.
(Hint: The 'pass' commands are just for if a method is empty. Once you have coded a method you can
delete 'pass').
